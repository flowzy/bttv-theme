# BetterTTV Dark Theme rework
This is a complete rework of the current dark theme that comes bundled with BetterTTV.
It was made from the ground up and is a lot more polished, but don't expect that everyone would like it, as it is more purple-ish than the original.

# Setup
1. Download this repository (as ZIP)
2. Extract folder "build" from the ZIP file and place it anywhere on your computer
3. Go into Google Chrome's settings and then "Extensions" (or just put *chrome://extensions/* into the URL bar)
4. Enable "Developer mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and navigate to the folder extracted earlier
6. Open Twitch.tv, press F12 and select "Console"
7. Find a dropdown menu "top" (http://i.imgur.com/AHg8pSZ.png)
8. Select "BetterTTV Theme"
9. Paste in *BetterTTV.storage.set({ settings: { theme: 'dark' } })* and press Enter
10. Refresh the page
11. Done.

**Disclaimer:** while testing this theme, it is suggested that you disable BetterTTV, because otherwise the styles of both will mix up and make everything look not as intended.

# Future plans
In the future I plan on adding back the more monotone color scheme which is used by current dark theme.
